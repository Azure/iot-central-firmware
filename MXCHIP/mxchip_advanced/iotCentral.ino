Full implementation of a device firmware for Azure IoT Central

Implements the following features:
•    Simple onboarding via a web UX
•    Simple device reset (press and hold the A & B buttons at the same time)
•    Display shows count of messages, errors, twin events, network information,
and device name (cycle through screens with B button) •    Telemetry sent for
all onboard sensors (configurable) •    State change telemetry sent when button
A pressed and the device cycles through the three states (NORMAL, CAUTION,
DANGER) •    Reported twin property sent for double tap of device (uses
accelerometer sensor data) •    Desired twin property to simulate turning on a
fan (fan sound plays from onboard headphone jack) •    Cloud to device messages
(supports sending a message to display on the screen) •    Direct twin method
calls (supports asking the device to play a rainbow sequence on the RGB LED) •
LED status of network, Azure IoT send events, Azure IoT error events, and
current device state (NORMAL=green, CAUTION=amber, DANGER=red)

Uses the following libraries:
•    Libraries installed by the MXChip IoT DevKit
(https://microsoft.github.io/azure-iot-developer-kit/): •    AureIoTHub -
https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-arduino •    AzureIoTUtility -
